I am currently pursuing an M.Phil in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, following the completion of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a Minor in Business Administration at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (University of Munich).

My research interests include systems, machine learning systems, and deep learning compilers.
